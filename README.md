randcp
=======

Copy random files from one directory to another. For adding random tracks to my
portable media player.

### Notes

This program copies files, not directories. Files are copied into the
root destination directory, directory structure is not preserved.

Multiple files with the same name in the source directory will not be able to
both be transfered to the destination, as this program does not check for name
conflicts when transferring files.
